## Future Roadmap

### LLM Integration
- **Smart categorization**: Use an LLM to categorize uncategorized transactions based on merchant name, amount patterns, and context — replacing keyword rules with intelligent classification
- **Spending insights**: Generate natural language summaries like "You spent 40% more on dining this month compared to last month" or "Your grocery spending is trending up"
- **Budget recommendations**: Suggest budget adjustments based on actual spending patterns — "You consistently overspend on Food & Dining, consider increasing to $600/mo"
- **Anomaly detection**: Flag unusual transactions — "This $500 charge at a new merchant doesn't match your typical spending"
- **Savings suggestions**: Identify subscriptions you rarely use, find cheaper alternatives, or suggest areas to cut back

### Additional Features
- **Email/password authentication** — alternative to Google sign-in
- **CSV import** — bulk upload transactions from bank exports
- **Multi-currency support** — for travel or international accounts
- **Recurring transaction auto-generation** — auto-create expense entries when subscriptions are due
- **Shared budgets** — household/partner budget collaboration
- **Goals & savings trackers** — save for specific targets with progress visualization
- **Bill reminders & notifications** — push alerts for upcoming bills or budget thresholds
- **Export to PDF/CSV** — monthly reports and tax-ready summaries
- **Investment tracking** — portfolio balance alongside spending
- **Canadian open banking** — direct bank API access when Consumer-Directed Finance launches (2026-2027)
- **Budget threshold notifications** — push/email alerts when spending reaches a user-provided threshold of a category budget
- **Mobile app** — React Native or PWA for on-the-go tracking
